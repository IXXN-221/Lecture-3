            <p>Founder and long-time environmentalist Jose Cano has launched the Earth Hub in the former seafarers chapel on Haven Rd that he restored in 2017 to become the Chapel Cafe.

                Cano said there was no more time for convincing people about climate change, it was time for action.
                
                "Ninety-eight per cent of scientists say that climate change is real and man-made, there's no more place for denial ... we have just eleven years to act to keep the Earth under 1.5 degrees [of warming], after that we're going to 2 degrees and unknown territory.
                
                "We know there are people who will say the Earth is flat. We can't stop them."
